## Introduction

With the creation of the first star, the formation of large-scale structures began and ultimately evolved into the present universe. Regarding the structure formation, two scenarios have been proposed: *top-down* and *bottom-up*. In the top-down scenario, clusters form first and fragment into galaxies. However, this scenario is not much appreciated and theoretical and observational indications rule this out. In the bottom-up scenario, primordial seeds of the universe formed protogalaxies which formed galaxies and then merged into clusters and then superclusters. This formation is favored by observations. This structure formation is spanned over the course of billions of years and is still continued today. New stars are being born and old stars are dying.

In all this situation, one thinks if the universe is composed of all the mighty cosmological objects then how much all this stuff weighs? How much does the universe weigh? Before weighing the universe, we must know where all the matter of the universe is located. This matter is divided into two categories — one which is known to us and emits light, and second is a little bit mysterious, somehow unknown to us, neither emits nor absorbs light of any wavelength.

The most prominent and largest sources of visible matter are the stars, and the most easy and well-known way to look at stars in larger regions. These mighty stellar objects emit photons of different wavelengths such as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet, in all directions. But they only contribute to **0.3%** of the total energy density of the universe. Even if we consider other stellar and sub-stellar objects such as neutron stars, black holes, black and brown dwarfs, this density parameter will still be much less than the observed one (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>).

Despite the fact that it is not an easy and handy task to detect all of the baryonic constituent of the universe, it is still interesting that nearly **85%** of the baryonic matter of the universe is in the form of interstellar medium (ISM)<d-footnote>Interstellar medium is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. This matter includes gas in ionic, atomic, and molecular form, as well as dust and cosmic rays. (Source: Wikipedia)</d-footnote> and a slender gas in intergalactic space<d-footnote>Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. It's almost empty, but not quite, as there are gas particles and so on floating around.</d-footnote>. However, Big Bang nucleosynthesis constrains that critical density of the universe cannot be comprised of normal material only; otherwise, the present abundances of light elements will not agree with the observations. Even if we consider CMB radiations along with BBN, this baryonic matter density parameter will still be less than the total energy density of the universe (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>).

The situation becomes worse when it is known to us that not only are we unable to detect a large percentage of baryonic matter, but the major constituent of the critical density of the universe is not even baryonic. In 1932, Jan Oort was observing the Sun and other stars in the Milky Way when he postulated the existence of this hidden constituent of the universe — *local dark matter* (<d-cite key="Bertone"></d-cite>). A strong evidence for Oort's observations was put forward by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 during the study of redshifts of galaxies in the Coma cluster (Abell 1656) (<d-cite key="jaan"></d-cite>). He found that individual velocities of galaxies are much greater than the mean velocity of the cluster. In this scenario, the cluster cannot hold in the form it is because of strong gravitational pull. The only way to shield from expansion is the assumption of some invisible matter which can provide enough gravitational force. Zwicky called this invisible matter *dunkle Materie* — dark matter.

Since dark matter does not emit, absorb, or scatter light, it is quite difficult to detect. It is theorized that it can interact only with conventional matter via gravitational force. Direct interaction is near impossible to detect with modern-day technologies. However, its gravitational influence on visible matter can be studied by inspecting orbital speeds of stars in spiral galaxies<d-footnote>In a spiral galaxy, the stars, gas, and dust are gathered in spiral arms that spread outward from the galaxy's center. (Source: <https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/217-What-is-a-spiral-galaxy->)</d-footnote> — for example, the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31).

At a length scale of a few kiloparsecs, the mass of a star inside that radius becomes essentially constant, and if stars contribute all (or most of) the mass of the galaxy, the orbital velocity will be proportional to the inverse square root of the radius. This is called **Keplerian rotation**. Using this, Kepler found that 99.8% of the mass of the solar system is contained within the Sun. In 1970, when Rubin and Ford calculated the orbital velocity of Andromeda at different radii, using the Keplerian relation, they didn't find any decrease in the Keplerian velocity and found it to be nearly constant. This cannot be possible unless stars contribute to most or all of the galaxy mass (<d-cite key="ryden_2017"></d-cite>). It provided a strong evidence for the presence of the *dark halo* — dark matter.

## Classification of Dark Matter

Usually, dark matter is classified in three categories: *hot, cold*, and *warm*. Although these terminologies have nothing to do with the degree of temperature, this classification is based on the distances traveled by the particles before they scatter — the **free-streaming length (FSL)**. This classification also guides us about the structure formation of dark matter — whether it follows bottom-up formation or top-down structure.

*Hot dark matter (HDM)* consists of particles having ultrarelativistic speeds, and their free-streaming length is larger than a protogalaxy<d-footnote>It is the large concentration of gas and dust from which a galaxy is formed. It is also called as “primeval galaxy.”</d-footnote>. HDM favors the top-down formation of the universe — the early universe first formed into larger groups of clusters and superclusters and then, with the passage of time, fragmented into smaller galaxies and other cosmological objects. But the data of CMBR acquired by COBE<d-footnote>Cosmic Background Explorer or Explorer 66.</d-footnote> discards the top-down formation and verifies the uniform and smooth formation of the universe. This formation is also unfavored by the observation of high redshift of galaxies. Moreover, the ultrarelativistic speeds of particles cannot allow these particles to clump together to form larger cosmological structures. Active neutrinos are thought to be one of its main candidates.

*Cold dark matter (CDM)* is composed of particles having smaller speeds than the speed of light, and their free-streaming length is much smaller than a protogalaxy. It favors bottom-up formation in the universe, which makes it capable of explaining the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This is responsible for the genesis of large-scale structures in the universe. CDM is thought to be the most perfect and successful interpretation of dark matter and structure formation of the universe. CDM also gives us an inkling of the presence of non-baryonic dark matter along with baryonic dark matter. There are a number of proposed candidates for CDM which span from sub-atomic particles to intergalactic objects. Its proposed candidates are **axions, MACHOs, thermal WIMPs,** and **supersymmetric particles**. Having a well-established theoretical framework, there are some proposed properties of CDM candidates:

- **Mass:** CDM candidates should be massive (>1 keV) along with a longer life.  
- **Collisionless:** CDM particles should be collisionless; they should only interact via gravity.  
- **Dissipationless:** They should not cool by radiating photons as ordinary baryonic matter does to form galaxies. With collisionless and dissipationless nature, they can form halos despite galactic structures (<d-cite key="einasto"></d-cite>). However, this is tricky because a massive particle with no electric charge will surely have some kind of dissipation (<d-cite key="carroll"></d-cite>).  
- **Lifetime:** Their lifetime must be comparable to or larger than the age of the present-day universe.

*Warm dark matter (WDM)* lies in between hot and cold dark matter. Particles which constitute WDM have a free-streaming length comparable to a protogalaxy. Its predictions are quite similar to cold dark matter but with a clear difference of small-scale density perturbations — it predicts less abundance of dwarf galaxies, a consequence of low density of dark matter in the central bulge of larger galaxies. Its proposed candidates are **sterile neutrinos, gravitinos,** and **non-thermal WIMPs**.

## Candidates of Dark Matter

In cosmology and particle physics, there is no shortage of proposed candidates for dark matter. They range from the tiniest neutrinos to black holes, showing both the variety of proposed models and the lack of our understanding.

Dark matter can be classified into two broad categories: **baryonic** and **non-baryonic**.  
Below we group the candidates according to the classification of dark matter.

### Baryonic Dark Matter

Big Bang nucleosynthesis puts a constraint that dark matter cannot be entirely baryonic; otherwise, the present density of light elements would be different (<d-cite key="roos_2008"></d-cite>). However, a smaller part of dark matter can be baryonic. Unlike other baryonic material, it is surely non-luminous and cannot be observed directly — but its gravitational effects on visible matter can be detected indirectly. Proposed baryonic candidates include **dust, clouds** of hot and cold gas, **snowballs of frozen hydrogenic matter**, and **collapsed stars** like brown dwarfs. Dust and clouds of gas were rejected while the others were grouped as **MACHOs** along with other similar objects (<d-cite key="badcosmo"></d-cite>).

### Non-Baryonic Dark Matter

A large part of dark matter consists of non-baryonic particles which do not radiate, absorb, or scatter light. Among dozens of different proposals, the most popular three candidates are **neutrinos**, **axions**, and **weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)**.

#### Candidates of Hot Dark Matter

**Active neutrinos.**  
Standard Model neutrinos (active neutrinos) are the lightest known fermions. They are electrically neutral and interact only via gravity and weak nuclear force. Being relativistic and collisionless particles, they favor top-down formation. But their relic mass density indicates there are not enough active neutrinos to be the dominant dark matter. However, **sterile neutrinos** may contribute.

#### Candidates of Warm Dark Matter

**Sterile neutrinos.**  
Proposed in 1993 by Scott Dodelson and Lawrence M. Widrow (<d-cite key="sterile1994"></d-cite>), sterile neutrinos are heavier than active ones. They have slower speeds, do not take part in oscillations, and interact only via gravity. Their mass can range from less than 1 eV to 10¹⁵ GeV. They were also proposed as a CDM candidate by Xiangdong Shi and George Fuller (<d-cite key="fuller1999"></d-cite>) if produced non-thermally with a small lepton asymmetry and masses between 100 eV and 10 keV.

#### Candidates of Cold Dark Matter

**MACHOs.**  
Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects include white dwarfs, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and even black holes. Composed of non-luminous baryonic matter, they were detected in 1993 by **gravitational microlensing**, when MACHOs near a star bend its light, temporarily brightening it — a rare phenomenon observed across millions of stars.

**Primordial black holes.**  
Formed before Big Bang nucleosynthesis, they are non-radiating and long-lived. Theoretical and observational mass limits range from 0.3–30 M☉, possibly up to 10⁵ M☉ (<d-cite key="roos_2008"></d-cite>).

**Thermal WIMPs.**  
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are massive, neutral, non-relativistic, and interact mainly via gravity. During the early universe, they were in thermal equilibrium with photons, but as the universe cooled, annihilations froze out, leaving a stable relic population — today’s dark matter (<d-cite key="freeman2006"></d-cite>).

**Axions.**  
Hypothetical particles proposed in 1977 by Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in QCD. Non-relativistic, neutral, and produced non-thermally, axions could explain large-scale structure (<d-cite key="baltz2004"></d-cite>).

**Supersymmetric candidates.**  
Supersymmetry (SUSY) relates bosons and fermions, predicting superpartners like gravitinos, higgsinos, winos, and sneutrinos. The lightest SUSY particle (LSP) would be stable and an ideal dark matter candidate (<d-cite key="freeman2006"></d-cite>).

**Neutralinos.**  
A superposition of photino, higgsino, and zino — the likely LSP and a key SUSY dark matter candidate.

**Gravitinos.**  
Super-WIMPs interacting only gravitationally, with a mass around 10² TeV, or ~keV in some models — a potential CDM or WDM candidate (<d-cite key="taoso2008"></d-cite>).

**Sneutrinos.**  
Superpartners of active neutrinos; once considered viable, but their cross-section is too large compared to dark matter limits (<d-cite key="falk1994"></d-cite>).

**Axinos.**  
Similar to gravitinos, classified as EWIMPs (Exceedingly Weakly Interacting Mediating Particles), mass from eV to GeV, produced thermally or non-thermally (<d-cite key="taoso2008"></d-cite>).

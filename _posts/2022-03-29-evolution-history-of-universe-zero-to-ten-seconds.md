## Introduction

William Shakespeare, in *Hamlet*, wrote: “I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself king of infinite space.” This subtle dialogue captures the human attempt to comprehend the universe. The discernment of this *infinite space* began when humankind first gazed at the bluish, vast, and mysterious dome above — the sky. This marks the origin of **cosmology** — a science devoted to studying the universe based on theoretical predictions, expressed through elegant mathematical equations, and observations coming from far–off regions of the cosmos. Cosmology, being distinct from other branches of science, is special in its essence; it seeks to understand the ultimate cause of creation and how things work at the most fundamental level. Let us take a brief look at how our cosmos evolved into its present state.

The story of **physical cosmology** centers around the exploration of the **Hot Big Bang Model**, the widely accepted model explaining how the universe came into being and evolved. According to this model, the universe began with a *mighty bang* — an explosive expansion of an infinitely dense singularity containing all matter, energy, and spacetime. As time progressed, this singularity expanded and cooled. The term *Big Bang* was coined in 1949 by **Fred Hoyle**<d-footnote>Fred Hoyle introduced the term “Big Bang” during a BBC radio broadcast, though he himself did not support the theory.</d-footnote>. The Big Bang occurred nearly **13.8 billion years ago**, and since then, the universe has passed through a series of evolutionary stages, visually represented in Figure below.  

Cosmologists categorize this evolution into three main stages:

1. Very Early Universe 
2. Early Universe
3. Large–Scale Structure Formation2022-03-29-evolution-history-of-universe-zero-to-ten-seconds

These stages are further divided into several **epochs** based on theoretical models, observational data, and experimental evidence.

## The Planck Era ($t < 10^{-43}$ seconds)

The era that began just after the Big Bang and lasted up to one Planck second ($10^{-43}$ seconds) is known as the **Planck Era**. Einstein’s *General Relativity* becomes applicable from this scale onward, but there exists neither an implementable theory nor an observational probe to reveal what occurred *before* the Planck time. It is theorized that during this epoch, all fundamental forces — gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak — were unified into a single interaction, often called the force of quantum gravity<d-footnote>The unification of all four fundamental forces is a hypothetical state described by various approaches to quantum gravity, including string theory and loop quantum gravity.</d-footnote>. At the end of this epoch, the grand unified force (the combination of electroweak and strong nuclear forces) separated from gravity — marking the **first symmetry breaking** in the history of the universe.

## The Grand Unification Epoch ($10^{-43} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-35} \, \text{seconds}$)

Beginning from $10^{-43}$ seconds, the **Grand Unification Epoch** lasted until about $10^{-35}$ seconds. It is the first known era for which we have *somewhat* applicable physical theories. Many crucial events occurred during this epoch. It triggered the phenomenon of **cosmic inflation**, proposed by *Alan Guth* in the early 1980s (<d-cite key="guth1981inflation"></d-cite>). During this period, the electroweak force separated from the **strong nuclear force**, marking the start of the Electroweak Era, which continued until approximately $10^{-12}$ seconds. Inflation is regarded as an exponential expansion of space that lasted from about $10^{-36}$ seconds to $10^{-32}$ seconds. This rapid expansion distributed the newly formed elementary particles evenly throughout the universe and cooled its overall temperature. 

As inflation ended, an enormous amount of energy was released, reheating the universe and transforming it into a hot quark–gluon plasma — a process known as **reheating**, which lasted up to about $10^{-12}$ seconds. By roughly $10^{-11}$ seconds, all four fundamental forces had acquired their distinct identities, each becoming a separate ruling interaction of nature. With this milestone, the Very Early Universe Era came to an end.

## The Quark Epoch ($10^{-12} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-6} \, \text{seconds}$)

The Early Universe Era began with the **Quark Epoch**, which lasted up to about $10^{-6}$ seconds. Although all four fundamental forces had by then separated, the universe remained extremely hot and dense — filled with a quark–gluon plasma. Within this fiery soup, quarks began to bind together through gluons, forming composite particles known as hadrons. Around this time, the electromagnetic force decoupled from the weak nuclear force, allowing them to act independently. Another pivotal event occurred during this epoch: **baryogenesis** — a process responsible for creating an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe.

This epoch marks the **first instance where matter began to dominate antimatter**. Although most matter and antimatter particles annihilated upon collision, a tiny excess of matter — roughly one extra particle in every billion pairs — survived<d-footnote>This minute imbalance between matter and antimatter is the reason any matter exists in the present universe.</d-footnote>. The cause of this asymmetry remains one of the **greatest unsolved mysteries in cosmology**.

---

## The Hadron Epoch ($10^{-6} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10^{-4} \, \text{seconds}$)

Despite the effects of **baryogenesis**, the extremely high temperature of the early universe made it possible for hadrons to annihilate once again into free quarks, reducing the overall matter number density. However, the next — and very brief — epoch, known as the **Hadron Epoch**, firmly established the dominance of matter over antimatter. During this epoch, the universe witnessed the formation of what is often described as a **“protonic soup.”** Since the proton is the least massive hadron, this phase concluded when the temperature of the universe dropped below its threshold temperature of approximately $10^{13}$ kelvin<d-footnote>At temperatures higher than $10^{13}$ K, protons and neutrons could not remain bound and would dissociate into free quarks and gluons.</d-footnote>. By the end of this epoch, the universe was filled with free baryons, consisting mainly of protons, neutrons, photons, and a few other subatomic particles — setting the stage for the Lepton Epoch that followed.

---

## The Lepton Epoch ($10^{-4} \, \text{seconds} \rightarrow 10 \, \text{seconds}$)

The Hadron Epoch was followed by the **Lepton Epoch**, which spanned from approximately $10^{-4}$ seconds to about $10$ seconds after the Big Bang. This epoch consisted of two significant phases: *neutrino decoupling* and *leptogenesis*.

During the **neutrino decoupling** phase, neutrinos began to separate from matter when the universe was roughly one second old and had a temperature of about ten billion kelvin ($10^{10}$ K). In this period, neutrinos stopped interacting with baryonic matter and no longer influenced the universe’s overall dynamics. Before decoupling, neutrinos and antineutrinos were in thermal equilibrium, maintained through processes of annihilation and scattering. However, as the universe expanded, the interaction rate of neutrinos via the weak force fell below the cosmic expansion rate, leading to their decoupling.

Some scientists have suggested that, as a result of this decoupling, there must exist *relic neutrinos*, analogous to the cosmic microwave background radiations<d-footnote>Cosmic microwave background radiations (CMB) are the relic electromagnetic radiation from the time of recombination, serving as a snapshot of the universe when it was about 380,000 years old.</d-footnote>, permeating throughout the universe. If these cosmic background neutrinos truly exist, they would provide an extraordinary observational probe to study such an early phase of the universe and reveal its initial conditions<d-footnote>If future observations confirm their existence, these relic neutrinos would serve as a unique window into the earliest seconds of cosmic evolution.</d-footnote>.

## Leptogenesis ($t \sim 1 \, \text{second} \rightarrow 14 \, \text{seconds}$)

Immediately after the neutrino decoupling, the universe entered the phase of **leptogenesis**. During this period, heavier leptons such as tau and muon particles were produced, but as the temperature continued to decrease, most of these heavy leptons annihilated or decayed into their lighter counterpart — the electron. Similar to baryogenesis, leptogenesis culminated in the dominance of leptons over antileptons. At this stage, the universe resembled a **particle soup** composed of electrons, positrons, protons, neutrinos, neutrons, and photons.

An important outcome of this era was the **nearly equalized proton–neutron ratio**. Initially, a high neutrino interaction rate with neutrons caused many to convert into protons. However, as the universe cooled, this conversion slowed, and the ratio began to decrease<d-footnote>As the universe expanded and cooled, weak interactions that converted neutrons to protons froze out, leaving a residual neutron-to-proton ratio of roughly 1:6.</d-footnote>. Once the temperature dropped below the electron threshold temperature ($\sim 10^{10}$ K), neutrinos ceased to interact with electrons and other particles, reaching a state of thermal equilibrium. This epoch ended when the universe was around **fourteen seconds old**, leading into the **Photon Epoch**.  
Before diving into that, however, we will next discuss another pivotal chapter in cosmic evolution — **Big Bang Nucleosynthesis**, which forged the first atomic nuclei in the young universe.
